# Overview

1. Implementation

   In our project, we have implemented the Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization method with 5000 iterations. The process involves:

   Input: Historical return data for each equity in the Indian market.

   Objective: Maximize expected return while minimizing portfolio variance.

   Optimization: Utilize an iterative approach, adjusting weights to find the optimal allocation.

   Output: The final set of weights that represent the optimal portfolio allocation.
